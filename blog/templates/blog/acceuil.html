                <p>As a continuous learner, I created this space to showcase the various projects I've been working on. The topics I explore are diverse, reflecting the different fields I've studied throughout my academic journey.
                     Some projects are related to biology, others touch on economics, and many involve statistics and data analysis.</p>


                    <p>I'm open-minded and driven by a strong desire to keep learning and improving. I warmly invite you to explore my work — and please don’t
